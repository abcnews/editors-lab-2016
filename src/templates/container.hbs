                    <p>For a change in government to occur, marginal seats must swing to the opposition. The AEC defines a marginal seat as having been won by less than five per cent.</p>
					<p>The extent to which marginal seats matter depends on the likely swing at an election. Maybe you think the swing will be smaller than five per cent, so take your pick.</p>

					<p>On of the best sources we have is the Australian Election Survey, an exit poll conducted after each federal election.</p>
					<p>The report released after the 2013 election shows that the number of swining voters, while on the rise, is still only around 54 per cent.</p>
					<p>It's only these swing voters who hold the power to change government. Let’s remove anyone who isn’t a swing voter.</p>
